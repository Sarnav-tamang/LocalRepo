    <h2>The Lyrics are as Follows</h2>
    <br>
    <pre>Chorus:
        Now he’s thinkin’ 'bout me every night, oh
        Is it that sweet? I guess so
        Say you can’t sleep, baby, I know
        That’s that me espresso
        Move it up, down, left, right, oh
        Switch it up like Nintendo
        Say you can’t sleep, baby, I know
        That’s that me espresso

        Post-Chorus:
        Holy shit
        Is it that sweet?
        Verse 1:
        I can’t relate to desperation
        My give-a-fucks are on vacation
        And I got this one boy and he won’t stop calling
        When they act this way, I know I got 'em

        Pre-Chorus:
        (Mm) Too bad your ex don’t do it for ya
        (Mm) Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
        (Mm) Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
        (Yes) I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
        (Yes) That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
        (Yes) One touch and I brand-newed it for ya
        (Ooh)
        </pre>
